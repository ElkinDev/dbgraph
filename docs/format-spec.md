# Compact Format Specification (US-019)

This document is the CONTRACT that all `src/core/present/` formatters conform to.
Changing a golden file REQUIRES a corresponding edit to this document and a token-delta
justification in the PR description.

---

## 1. Line Grammar

### 1.1 Object header line

```
qname  [kind]
```

Examples:

```
dbo.orders  [table]
dbo.orders.order_id  [column]
dbo.usp_ProcessOrder  [procedure]
```

For engines without a schema namespace (SQLite), the bare object name is used:

```
orders  [table]
```

### 1.2 Column lines (inside `COLUMNS` section)

```
  emp_id  INTEGER  [PK]
  dept_id  INTEGER  [FK→main.departments]  [NN]
  customer_id  int  [FK→dbo.customers.customer_id]  [NN]
  email  TEXT
  salary  REAL  [NN]  DEFAULT 0.0
```

- `[PK]` — primary key member (declared order preserved for composite keys)
- `[FK→target]` — foreign-key reference. The rendered `target` follows the D8 precedence
  (change explore-payloads): the constraint payload's target VERBATIM when present
  (column-level, e.g. `[FK→dbo.customers.customer_id]`); else the RECONSTRUCTED
  table-level target from the node's `references` edge when unambiguous
  (e.g. `[FK→main.departments]`); else NO `[FK→…]` marker at all — honest degradation,
  never a guessed target.
- `[NN]` — NOT NULL (non-nullable without a PK constraint)
- `DEFAULT value` — appended when a default is defined

Markers render in the order `[PK]  [FK→…]  [NN]`, each separated by two spaces
(`[NN]` is suppressed on a PK column). Column lines are indented two spaces.

### 1.2a Constraint / index / trigger lines (payload sections)

Rendered by the ONE shared payload helper (`src/core/present/payload.ts`) inside the
`CONSTRAINTS`, `INDEXES` and `TRIGGERS` sections of BOTH `dbgraph_object` and
`dbgraph_explore` (change explore-payloads — same source, byte-identical sections):

```
CONSTRAINTS
  [PK]  pk_name  (col, col, col)
  [FK]  fk_name  (col → main.departments)
  [FK]  fk_name  (emp_id, dept_id → main.employees)
  [FK]  fk_name  (col)
  [UNIQUE]  uq_name  (col)

INDEXES
  index_name  (col, col)
  index_name  UNIQUE (col)
  index_name  (col) [method]

TRIGGERS
  trigger_name  TIMING EVENT
  trigger_name  TIMING EVENT, EVENT
```

- The constraint FK `→ target` follows the SAME D8 precedence as the column `[FK→…]`
  marker: payload target verbatim, else the reconstructed table-level target, else the
  columns render WITHOUT a `→ target`. Composite keys keep DECLARED column order.
- Constraints, indexes and triggers are each sorted by name; columns inside a
  constraint or index preserve declared order.

### 1.3 Annotation suffix on object header

```
qname  [kind]  [Nidx, Ntrg!]
```

- `Nidx` — count of associated indexes (omitted when 0)
- `Ntrg!` — count of triggers, with `!` marking hidden trigger logic

Examples:

```
dbo.orders  [table]  [2 idx, 1 trg!]
dbo.products  [table]  [1 idx]
```

### 1.4 Edge lines (inside `RELATED` and `WRITES` sections)

Outbound edge:

```
  → target_qname  [edge_kind]
```

Inbound edge:

```
  ← source_qname  [edge_kind]
```

For inferred edges, a score suffix is added:

```
  → target_qname  [inferred_reference, score=0.85]
```

### 1.5 Section headers

```
OBJECT
COLUMNS
RELATED
WRITES
```

Each section header is unindented. Content lines inside a section are indented two spaces.
An empty section is omitted entirely.

## 2. Detail Levels

Three levels control how much information is rendered per formatter call.
The level is supplied by the tool caller as `detail?: 'brief' | 'normal' | 'full'`.

| Level    | Description                                                                                              |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `brief`  | Object header + annotation counts only. No column details, no neighbor qnames. Lowest token cost.       |
| `normal` | Brief + grouped neighbors (edge kind / direction / sorted qnames). No body or bodyHash. Default level.  |
| `full`   | Normal + bodyHash, indexing level, body (for modules), and `hasDynamicSql` warning when applicable.     |

Per-tool level defaults and what each section shows:

| Tool              | brief                       | normal                                | full                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `dbgraph_explore` | header + counts             | + COLUMNS, CONSTRAINTS, grouped neighbors | + INDEXES, TRIGGERS, bodyHash, level, dynamic-SQL warning |
| `dbgraph_search`  | type + qname + rank         | + match column                        | + excerpt                                 |
| `dbgraph_object`  | header + annotation counts  | + columns (type/null/default), FK/PK  | + indexes, triggers, body (modules)       |
| `dbgraph_related` | grouped edge kinds + counts | + qnames per group                    | + inferred score, body excerpts           |
| `dbgraph_impact`  | chain summary               | + full chain (a→b→c), read/write split| + node types, dynamic-SQL / truncation ⚠  |
| `dbgraph_path`    | route qnames only           | + join columns per hop                | + inferred marks, no-route neighbor list  |
| `dbgraph_status`  | engine/version + last sync  | + per-type counts, configured levels  | + excluded objects, drift detail          |
| `dbgraph_precheck`| matched objects list        | + aggregated impact sections          | + confidence tags, unmatched identifiers  |

---

## 3. Pagination Contract

Tools returning lists (`dbgraph_search`, and any tool whose result can exceed its budget)
use `offset` / `limit` / `hasMore`:

```
offset  — zero-based position of the first returned item (default 0)
limit   — maximum items in this response (tool-specific default; see budget table)
hasMore — true when results beyond the returned page remain; false when this is the last page
```

The footer line format:

```
--- N results | offset M | hasMore: true ---
```

or when on the last page:

```
--- N results (total) | offset M ---
```

Callers advance `offset` by `limit` to fetch the next page. Cursor-based pagination is out of scope.

---

## 4. Token Budget Methodology

Token costs are measured EMPIRICALLY on the committed SQLite torture fixture at
`test/fixtures/sqlite/`. The approximation formula is:

```
tokens ≈ ceil(output_chars / 4)
```

This is the documented LLM tokenizer approximation used by OpenAI and Anthropic.
It slightly overestimates, making budgets conservative.

Measurement procedure (performed in Batch E, task 5.4):
1. Start the in-process `InMemoryTransport` harness over the torture fixture.
2. Call each tool at each `detail` level with a representative entity that has ≤ 30 relationships.
3. Capture the output string length.
4. Apply `ceil(chars / 4)`.
5. Record the result in the table below and replace every "TBD until measured" placeholder.
6. Add a brief-budget assertion in `test/core/present/` verifying the measured ceiling is respected.

---

## 5. Per-Tool / Per-Detail Token Budget Table

All ceilings are EMPIRICALLY measured (Batch E, task 5.4) on the committed SQLite torture fixture
(`test/fixtures/sqlite/torture.sql`) using `main.employees` (a table with ≤ 30 relationships) as
the representative entity. Formula: `ceil(chars / 4)`. Ceilings include a ~25–50% headroom
margin above the measured value to accommodate slightly larger entities.

Measured raw values and headroom ceilings:

| Tool              | brief measured / ceiling | normal measured / ceiling | full measured / ceiling |
|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| `dbgraph_explore` | 209 chars→53 tk / 75     | 1365 chars→342 tk / 400   | 1756 chars→439 tk / 480 |
| `dbgraph_search`  | 209 chars→53 tk / 275    | 209 chars→53 tk / 275     | 294 chars→74 tk / 400   |
| `dbgraph_object`  | 66 chars→17 tk / 30      | 369 chars→93 tk / 110     | 713 chars→179 tk / 225  |
| `dbgraph_related` | 57 chars→15 tk / 80      | 296 chars→74 tk / 400     | 296 chars→74 tk / 400   |
| `dbgraph_impact`  | 29 chars→8 tk / 50       | 34 chars→9 tk / 55        | 34 chars→9 tk / 55      |
| `dbgraph_path`    | 62 chars→16 tk / 80      | 62 chars→16 tk / 80       | 62 chars→16 tk / 80     |
| `dbgraph_status`  | 44 chars→11 tk / 65      | 190 chars→48 tk / 250     | 198 chars→50 tk / 265   |
| `dbgraph_precheck`| 25 chars→7 tk / 40       | 290 chars→73 tk / 85      | 479 chars→120 tk / 140  |

Simplified ceiling table (tokens — use these for budget assertions):

| Tool              | `brief` (tokens) | `normal` (tokens) | `full` (tokens) |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `dbgraph_explore` | 75               | 400               | 480             |
| `dbgraph_search`  | 275              | 275               | 400             |
| `dbgraph_object`  | 30               | 110               | 225             |
| `dbgraph_related` | 80               | 400               | 400             |
| `dbgraph_impact`  | 50               | 55                | 55              |
| `dbgraph_path`    | 80               | 80                | 80              |
| `dbgraph_status`  | 65               | 250               | 265             |
| `dbgraph_precheck`| 40               | 85                | 140             |

Note: `dbgraph_path` only has found/no-route variants, not brief/normal/full; the ceiling uses the
larger no-route output. `dbgraph_status` includes a non-deterministic ISO timestamp
(~25 chars) that is excluded from deterministic golden comparisons but included in budget accounting.

**Golden change (phase-5-mcp-server remediation)**: `test/mcp/golden/path-tool-noroute.txt` re-captured
after fixing C-1 (raw node IDs → qnames in no-route neighbors). No-route output now shows
`main.departments` and `main.assignments` instead of 40-hex SHA-1 IDs. Token delta: 167 chars→42 tk
(old) → 137 chars→35 tk (new); ceiling 80 unchanged (headroom is sufficient).

**Golden change (phase-5-mcp-server remediation W-3)**: `test/mcp/golden/explore-{brief,normal,full}.txt`,
`related-tool-{brief,normal,full}.txt` re-captured after fixing W-3 (per-column FK edge duplication in
explore/related display). Multiple per-column + aggregate edges for the same FK now deduplicate to one
line per unique neighbor qname at display grain. `references` group for `main.employees`: was `2 out,
3 in` → now `1 out, 1 in` (departments×1, assignments×1). Token delta: explore-normal 382 chars→96 tk
(old) → 330 chars→83 tk (new); ceilings unchanged (headroom remains adequate).

**Golden change (change explore-payloads, §6 token-delta note)**: `dbgraph_explore` now renders the
focus node's per-kind PAYLOAD sections (`COLUMNS`, `CONSTRAINTS` at `normal`; `+INDEXES`, `+TRIGGERS` at
`full`) via the ONE shared payload helper that also backs `dbgraph_object`, so the section bytes are
byte-identical across the two tools. In the SAME change, the D8 FK reconstruction re-blesses ONLY the FK
lines of `main.employees` in both surfaces — the `dept_id` column becomes
`  dept_id  INTEGER  [FK→main.departments]  [NN]` and its constraint becomes
`  [FK]  fk_employees_0  (dept_id → main.departments)` (the target reconstructed from the `references`
edge because the SQLite FK payload carries none); every non-FK line stays byte-identical. Re-captured
goldens: `test/mcp/golden/explore-{normal,full}.txt` and `object-tool-{normal,full}.txt`; NEW
`test/mcp/golden/explore-view.txt` pinning `main.active_departments  [view]` (the D3 `[view]` resolution
fix). `explore-brief.txt` and `object-tool-brief.txt` are UNCHANGED (no payload at `brief`). Token delta
(re-measured on the torture fixture, `ceil(chars/4)`):
- `dbgraph_explore` normal: 330 chars→83 tk (old) → 1365 chars→342 tk (new); ceiling 400 UNCHANGED (342 ≤ 400).
- `dbgraph_explore` full: ~303 chars→76 tk (old) → 1756 chars→439 tk (new); this EXCEEDS the prior 420
  ceiling, so the full ceiling is WIDENED **420 → 480** (≈9% headroom over the measured 439). The ceiling
  POLICY and `ceil(chars/4)` methodology are UNCHANGED — only this one ceiling moved, and only because a
  fixture exceeded it.
- `dbgraph_object` normal: 82 chars→21 tk (old) → 369 chars→93 tk (new); ceiling 110 UNCHANGED (93 ≤ 110).
- `dbgraph_object` full: 168 chars→42 tk (old) → 713 chars→179 tk (new); ceiling 225 UNCHANGED (179 ≤ 225).
- `test/mcp/golden/explore-view.txt` (new): 82 chars→21 tk.
The composite-FK reconstruction for `main.assignments` (`(emp_id, dept_id → main.employees)`, declared-order
PK `(project_id, emp_id, dept_id)`) is pinned from the REAL built graph in the object/explore tool tests
(the generated constraint name `fk_assignments_0` was captured, not guessed).

**Golden change (change sqlite-view-deps, §5 token-delta note)**: the SQLite adapter now derives view
`depends_on` edges (view bodies) and trigger `writes_to` edges (trigger action bodies) via the shared
presence-gate tokenizer, and `buildFiresOnEdges` resolves a trigger's `fires_on` target to the real node
kind (killing the phantom `[table] active_departments` stub). The new edges surface dependent views/triggers
across the neighbor-bearing tool goldens. Re-captured goldens: `test/mcp/golden/explore-{brief,normal,full}.txt`
(`main.employees` gains 2 inbound `depends_on` neighbors — the views), `explore-view.txt`
(`main.active_departments` now shows its `depends_on` OUT targets + `fires_on` trigger), `impact-tool-*.txt`,
`related-tool-*.txt`, and `precheck-tool-{normal,full}.txt` (the employees DDL now surfaces the dependent
views in READERS + WHAT TO TEST); plus `test/fixtures/sqlite/golden-{raw-catalog,e2e}.json`
(`edgeCount 54→64`, `nodeCount 54→53`, `stubCount 1→0`). Token delta (re-measured on the torture fixture,
`ceil(chars/4)`):
- `dbgraph_precheck` normal: was ≤ 65 tk → now 290 chars→73 tk; this EXCEEDS the prior 65 ceiling, so the
  normal ceiling is WIDENED **65 → 85** (≈16% headroom over the measured 73).
- `dbgraph_precheck` full: was ≤ 110 tk → now 479 chars→120 tk; this EXCEEDS the prior 110 ceiling, so the
  full ceiling is WIDENED **110 → 140** (≈17% headroom over the measured 120).
- `dbgraph_impact` normal/full: 219 chars→55 tk (within the 55 ceiling — UNCHANGED).
- `dbgraph_related` normal/full: 1179 chars→295 tk (within the 400 ceiling — UNCHANGED).
- `dbgraph_explore` normal/full: 1465 chars→367 tk / 1856 chars→464 tk (within the 400 / 480 ceilings —
  UNCHANGED). The ceiling POLICY and `ceil(chars/4)` methodology are UNCHANGED — only the two precheck
  ceilings moved, and only because a fixture exceeded them. Cross-engine (pg/mssql/mysql) goldens are
  byte-identical (the fix's blast radius is SQLite-only) and `benchmark/questions.yaml` is untouched.

**Golden change (change dog1-calls-edges, §C.3/C.6 note)**: routine→routine invocation now emits a
`calls` edge (mssql `declared`; pg/mysql `parsed`), and the shared present formatters
(`explore.ts`/`related.ts`/`object.ts`) render it AUTOMATICALLY — they iterate
`Object.keys(neighbors).sort()` with NO edge-kind allowlist, so a `calls` group appears the moment the
edge exists. Per §1.4 edge-line grammar it renders as a normal grouped neighbor: a calling routine shows
an OUTBOUND `→ callee  [procedure|function]` line under a `calls` group; the invoked routine shows the
INBOUND `← caller` line; a routine with no invocations renders NO `calls` group (never fabricated). CLI
`explore` and the MCP tool share the formatter, so the `calls` rendering is byte-identical across both
surfaces. ONE new deliberate synthetic golden is added — `test/core/present/golden/explore-calls.txt`
(the caller's `normal` output over a synthetic `dbo.usp_refresh_totals --calls--> dbo.usp_log_change`
routine chain, 195 chars→49 tk). NO existing golden is re-blessed: the default-CI mcp/present golden
substrate is the routine-free SQLite torture fixture, which emits ZERO `calls` edges → zero drift; the
mssql/pg/mysql `calls` render + impact traversal are proven in the synthetic unit tier and the
`DBGRAPH_INTEGRATION`-gated container tier. Impact traversal adds `calls` as a READ-impact kind
(`IMPACT_EDGE_KINDS`), so `dbgraph_impact`/`dbgraph_precheck` surface a called routine's CALLERS in the
read / what-to-test sections without over-reporting writes; token ceilings are UNCHANGED (SQLite substrate
is routine-free → no measured output moved).

**Golden change (change dog2-routine-parameters, §6 token-delta note)**: a routine FOCUS node
(`procedure`/`function`) now renders a `PARAMETERS` section via the ONE shared `renderParameters` helper
in `present/payload.ts`, wired into BOTH `renderFocusPayload` (explore) AND `formatObject` (object), so the
section bytes are byte-identical across CLI/MCP × explore/object (no per-surface branch). Grammar mirrors
`COLUMNS`: each line is `  <name>  <dataType>` (2-space indent, double-space gaps) then UPPERCASE bracket
markers `[OUT]` / `[INOUT]` / `[DEFAULT]` joined by two spaces — an `in` parameter carries NO direction
marker (the default, exactly as a nullable column shows no `[NN]`), and `[DEFAULT]` is a PRESENCE marker
only (the default VALUE is never rendered). Detail-gated to `normal` and `full`, absent at `brief` (the
COLUMNS analog). A routine whose `parameters` is UNSET or empty renders NO section (honest absence). ONE
new deliberate synthetic golden family is added — `test/core/present/golden/param-render-explore-normal.txt`
and `param-render-object-normal.txt` (a `dbo.usp_mixed` routine focus exercising every marker,
in/[OUT]/[INOUT]/[DEFAULT]). NO existing mcp/present golden is re-blessed: the default-CI mcp/present golden
substrate is the routine-free SQLite torture fixture (TABLE focus `main.employees`), which has no routine
node and therefore emits ZERO `PARAMETERS` sections → the `test/mcp/golden/*` and existing
`test/core/present/golden/*` goldens are byte-identical (a move would be a HARD STOP). The mssql/pg/mysql
`golden-raw-catalog.json` aggregates gain `parameters` arrays DELIBERATELY in the `DBGRAPH_INTEGRATION`-gated
tier (every other byte unchanged); the summary-shaped `golden-e2e.json` files carry no node payloads so they
are unchanged. Token ceilings are UNCHANGED (SQLite substrate is routine-free → no measured MCP output moved).

## 6. Golden Discipline

A golden file is a committed text file whose content is the byte-identical expected output of
a formatter invoked with a fixed `*View` input struct.

Rules:
- A golden file MUST be committed before the corresponding formatter code is written (RED-first).
- Changing a golden file REQUIRES both a corresponding edit to this `format-spec.md` document
  AND a token-delta justification in the PR description explaining why the output changed.
- Goldens under `test/core/present/golden/` cover formatter × detail (unit-level, fixed view structs).
- Goldens under `test/mcp/golden/` cover tool × detail (E2E-level, through the transport harness).
- Every golden assertion must be byte-identical: `expect(output).toBe(goldenContent)`.

---

## 7. Purity Contract

Every formatter in `src/core/present/` MUST be a pure function:
- No `process.env` reads
- No `Date.now()` or clock calls
- No `Math.random()`
- No file I/O or network calls
- Same `(*View, detail)` input → always the exact same output bytes (ADR-008)

---

## 8. Consumers of this contract

The formatters in `src/core/present/` are the SINGLE source of object-detail truth. Every
surface that shows a node's detail reuses them — there is NO second renderer:

- CLI `dbgraph object` / `dbgraph explore` and MCP `dbgraph_object` — direct callers.
- `dbgraph viz` (see `docs/viz.md`) — the interactive HTML export pre-renders each node's
  detail with `formatObject(view, 'full')` server-side and injects it verbatim into a
  `<pre>`. A node's viz detail panel is therefore BYTE-IDENTICAL to
  `dbgraph object <qname> --detail full`; a `test/core/viz/detail-parity` test pins this, so
  a change to this contract that drifts the two fails the build.

The live viz force animation is NOT covered by any golden (ADR-008 honest split) — only the
deterministic embedded data block, community assignment, and Mermaid ER text are pinned.
