# Design: Standalone binaries via Node SEA — esbuild bundle, release workflow, installers (phase-9.5c)

## Technical Approach

Node SEA (ratified over `bun build --compile`). ONE esbuild pass bundles a dedicated SEA entry
(`src/bin/sea-entry.ts`) into a single self-contained **CJS** file; the 5 DB drivers +
`better-sqlite3` are marked `external` so their `import()` calls survive as runtime dynamic imports
(ADR-006 lazy/optional preserved — NOT statically bundled). `node --experimental-sea-config`
produces the SEA blob; `postject` injects it into a copied, version-PINNED Node binary. Windows runs
the steps natively; Linux runs the SAME steps inside a Docker container. The binary's guaranteed
capability is READ/serve of an already-indexed graph on the **in-binary `node:sqlite`** (9.5b seam,
ZERO native/driver modules); the binary flips the local-store default to `node:sqlite` under SEA.
Live extraction from the binary loads a DB driver only when the user has one resolvable
(CWD `node_modules` → `NODE_PATH` → global); absent → the EXISTING `npm i <driver>` error. A written,
trigger-guarded `release.yml` (tag + dispatch ONLY, NEVER fired) and two checksum-verifying
installers complete the LOCAL, CI-quota-safe half. `--version` is embedded at bundle time (no disk
read). ADR-009 formalizes SEA and refines ADR-006's "static bundling in the binaries" clause.

The pinned build Node is **24 LTS**, chosen specifically so `node:sqlite` needs **no runtime flag**
(the `--experimental-sqlite` flag was dropped after Node 23.4) — this makes the hardest SEA problem
(passing runtime flags into a blob) disappear. The first apply task empirically confirms this on the
actual installed Node; both outcomes (flag-needed vs not) are designed below.

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: D1 — Drivers stay EXTERNAL/optional in the binary (refines ADR-006)
**Choice**: esbuild marks `better-sqlite3`, `mysql2`, `mysql2/promise`, `pg`, `mssql`, `mongodb` (and subpaths) as `external`; the binary READS/serves on in-binary `node:sqlite` with zero drivers; live extraction loads a driver only if resolvable. | **Alternatives**: (a) statically bundle the 5 drivers per ADR-006's literal wording — breaks "works without any driver installed", bloats size, pulls native `.node` into a blob esbuild cannot inline; (b) bundle better-sqlite3, external the 4 network drivers — still forces a native module into the blob. | **Rationale**: the "works without any driver" guarantee is load-bearing (ADR-006 spirit) and the whole reason 9.5b existed. Drivers are pure runtime-optional integrations; keeping them `external` mirrors the npm path byte-for-byte and preserves the exact `import('<driver>' as string)` seam. ADR-009 refines ADR-006's one bundling sentence; ADR-006's pure-JS-driver + lazy-optional decisions stand.

### Decision: D2 — Binary forces the local store to `node:sqlite` under SEA
**Choice**: in `src/infra/open-connections.ts`, when `sea.isSea()` is true, pass `driver: 'node:sqlite'` to `createSqliteGraphStore`; npm/dev path unchanged (default `better-sqlite3`). | **Alternatives**: keep the better-sqlite3 default and ship better-sqlite3 as a sidecar; probe-and-fallback at runtime. | **Rationale**: the store is the ONE component every command touches (read AND write). Under a no-`node_modules` binary, better-sqlite3's native `.node` is absent, so the default MUST flip to the in-binary `node:sqlite`. Gating on `isSea()` keeps the npm store byte-identical (ADR-008) and requires a single additive line at the composition root — not a change to the store, factory, or any core file. The `.dbgraph/dbgraph.db` file format is identical across drivers (9.5b), so a db written by better-sqlite3 reads under node:sqlite and vice-versa.

### Decision: D3 — Pin build Node 24 LTS so `node:sqlite` needs no runtime flag
**Choice**: pin the build+embed Node to **24 LTS** (exact patch in `.nvmrc` and ADR-009), where `require('node:sqlite')` works with NO flag. | **Alternatives**: pin 22 LTS (node:sqlite needs `--experimental-sqlite`, which SEA cannot bake into the blob and which is awkward to pass); pin 23. | **Rationale**: SEA offers no supported way to embed CLI flags (no `execArgv` in `sea-config.json`); `--experimental-sqlite` is not reliably honored via `NODE_OPTIONS` and breaks the "just run it" UX. Node 24 removes the flag requirement entirely (flag dropped after 23.4), collapsing the whole class of problems. Node 24 still emits a one-shot `ExperimentalWarning` for node:sqlite → the SEA entry installs a `process.on('warning')` filter that swallows ONLY that warning (stderr stays clean; stdout is already machine-clean). **Fallback (if the machine is stuck on 22):** `node:sqlite` needs `--experimental-sqlite`; mitigations = bump the pinned Node to ≥23.4/24 (strongly preferred) OR document `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-sqlite` as a stopgap in the installer README. The FIRST apply task decides empirically (see Batch 0).

### Decision: D4 — esbuild → single CJS bundle (not ESM)
**Choice**: `format: 'cjs'`, `platform: 'node'`, `target: 'node24'`, `bundle: true`, one output file `build/sea/dbgraph.cjs`. | **Alternatives**: ESM single-file. | **Rationale**: Node SEA's `main` script is executed as **CommonJS** — an ESM entry is not supported as a SEA main today. The source tree is ESM (`"type":"module"`, NodeNext); esbuild transpiles ESM→CJS cleanly. Consequences handled: `import.meta.url` in `cli.ts` is rewritten by esbuild (platform=node) to a `pathToFileURL(__filename)` shim; under SEA `__filename` is the executable path and `process.argv[1]` is a user arg, so `cli.ts`'s auto-run guard evaluates **false** (no double-run) — the dedicated SEA entry does the running. `__dirname`/`__filename` are real CJS natives in the blob and point at the executable's directory (useful for exe-adjacent driver resolution).

### Decision: D5 — Dedicated SEA entry `src/bin/sea-entry.ts` (bundle-only), single binary with `mcp` subcommand
**Choice**: one binary per platform; the SEA entry unconditionally dispatches: `mcp` (first user arg) → MCP stdio server; otherwise → `runCli`. Its args come from `process.argv` normalized for the SEA layout. | **Alternatives**: two binaries (`dbgraph` + `dbgraph-mcp`); bundle `cli.ts` directly. | **Rationale**: bundling `cli.ts` directly fails — its `import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1])` guard never fires in a SEA (no script-path arg), so the CLI would never run. A dedicated entry runs unconditionally and sidesteps the guard. One binary (not two) matches the single-file US-037 story, halves the release matrix, and yields one blob to postject/checksum/attest per platform. The MCP server is reached as `dbgraph mcp`; `server.ts` gains an exported `startMcpServer()` (its existing auto-run guard stays for the npm `dbgraph-mcp` bin). **SEA argv gotcha (empirical):** in a SEA, `process.argv` is `[execPath, ...userArgs]` — there is NO script-path slot, so user args start at index 1, not 2. `sea-entry` computes `const argv = process.argv.slice(sea.isSea() ? 1 : 2)`. Batch 0 confirms the exact layout on the pinned Node before wiring.

### Decision: D6 — `--version`/`-v` added to `runCli`, version embedded at bundle time
**Choice**: add a `--version`/`-v` branch to `runCli` that prints the resolved version and returns 0; the value is `process.env.DBGRAPH_BUILD_VERSION ?? DBGRAPH_VERSION`. esbuild `define` replaces `process.env.DBGRAPH_BUILD_VERSION` with the string literal read from `package.json` at bundle time. | **Alternatives**: read `package.json` from disk at runtime (impossible in a blob); import a generated `version.ts`. | **Rationale**: the binary must answer `--version` with no `package.json` on disk (US-037 success). A build-time `define` bakes the literal in — deterministic (ADR-008), no disk read. On the npm/dev path `process.env.DBGRAPH_BUILD_VERSION` is undefined → falls back to `DBGRAPH_VERSION='0.0.0'` (placeholder unchanged → `test/smoke.test.ts` stays green). This is the ONE intentional, minimal runtime addition; the spec captures it as a new AC under `binary-distribution`. (`--version` is a valid `runCli` addition because `cli.ts` already owns `--help`; it benefits both npm and binary.)

### Decision: D7 — Optional-driver loading centralized behind `loadOptionalDriver(name)` for deterministic SEA resolution
**Choice**: introduce `src/adapters/engines/_shared/load-optional-driver.ts` exporting `loadOptionalDriver(name)`; the 4 network factories call it instead of inlining `import('<driver>' as string)`. Under SEA (`sea.isSea()`) it resolves via `createRequire` with an explicit base (`process.cwd()` first, then `process.execPath`), honoring `$CWD/node_modules → NODE_PATH → global`; otherwise it is literally today's `await import(name)`. | **Alternatives**: rely on Node's undocumented SEA bare-specifier `import()` resolution; require users to set `NODE_PATH` only; scope live-extraction-from-binary out. | **Rationale**: ESM dynamic `import()` of a BARE specifier inside a SEA does not reliably walk CWD `node_modules`; `require`'s resolution IS well-defined (CWD-relative, `NODE_PATH`- and global-aware) and works in a SEA. Funneling all optional-driver loads through one seam makes binary driver resolution DETERMINISTIC and documented, keeps ADR-004 (drivers never enter core), and — critically — the non-SEA branch is byte-identical to the current code, so ADR-008 goldens and every existing factory test hold. The failure path is unchanged: resolution miss → existing `catch` → `ConnectivityUnavailableError` with the exact `npm i <driver>`. **Scope note:** the smoke does NOT need this (it uses node:sqlite). This seam is what makes live `init/sync` from the binary actually resolve drivers; if the team wants 9.5c strictly packaging-only, the fallback is to ship the seam but leave live-from-binary extraction "best effort via NODE_PATH" and defer robustness — flagged as Open Question Q1.

### Decision: D8 — SEA assembly pipeline: `scripts/sea/` + postject, per-platform outputs
**Choice**: `scripts/sea/build-bundle.mjs` (esbuild) → `build/sea/dbgraph.cjs`; `scripts/sea/sea-config.json`; `node --experimental-sea-config scripts/sea/sea-config.json` → `build/sea/dbgraph.blob`; copy the pinned Node → `postject` inject → `dist/bin/dbgraph-win-x64.exe` / `dist/bin/dbgraph-linux-x64`. Windows driver: `scripts/sea/build-sea.ps1`; Linux driver: `scripts/sea/build-sea.sh` (run inside Docker). | **Alternatives**: tsup for the bundle; a single cross-platform Node script instead of ps1+sh. | **Rationale**: raw esbuild gives exact control over `external`/`define`/`format` (D1/D4/D6) that tsup abstracts away. postject is the official Node SEA tool (justified as a dev-only build dependency per ADR-007). Per-platform shell drivers keep the postject `--sentinel-fuse` and (Windows) signature-removal steps explicit and auditable. Output names encode `<os>-<arch>` so installers derive assets deterministically.

### Decision: D9 — Linux build + smoke via Docker on a glibc base
**Choice**: build the linux binary inside `node:24-bookworm-slim` (glibc) with the repo bind-mounted, non-interactive; smoke it inside a **Node-less** `debian:bookworm-slim` container (NO node, NO node_modules) running `--version`, `--help`, and `init→sync→query` on a fixture. | **Alternatives**: Alpine/musl base; smoke inside a Node image. | **Rationale**: Docker is already a project dependency (Testcontainers integration suite). A glibc-built SEA binary needs a glibc runtime — build and smoke on the SAME libc (Debian); Alpine/musl would need a separate build (out of scope, noted). Smoking in a Node-LESS image is the strongest possible proof of "no Node, no node_modules required" — the only executable is the binary and the only sqlite is the one compiled into it.

### Decision: D10 — `release.yml` trigger-guarded to tag-push + `workflow_dispatch` ONLY, NEVER fired
**Choice**: `on: { push: { tags: ['v*.*.*'] }, workflow_dispatch: {} }` — NO branch push, NO `pull_request`; matrix `[windows-latest, ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]`; each leg builds bundle+SEA, emits `SHA256SUMS`; a release job runs `actions/attest-build-provenance` and creates the GitHub Release attaching binaries + `SHA256SUMS`. | **Alternatives**: also trigger on `push: branches` for "CI smoke"; publish to npm. | **Rationale**: CI quota is EXHAUSTED — the workflow must be impossible to fire by accident. Restricting triggers to tag-push + manual dispatch means no branch push, PR, or merge can start it; no tag is pushed this phase, so it stays dormant. `concurrency: { group: release-${{ github.ref }} }` mirrors the intended CI discipline. The macOS leg is present (for 9.5d) but validated only when CI eventually runs — it is NEVER exercised locally here.

### Decision: D11 — Installers `install.ps1` + `install.sh` verify SHA256 BEFORE install, fail closed
**Choice**: pure-shell installers (no runtime deps, ADR-007 spirit): detect platform/arch → derive asset name → download binary + `SHA256SUMS` from the pinned release → compute local hash → compare case-insensitively → on mismatch DELETE the partial download and exit non-zero → only then place on PATH-dir + print PATH guidance. Version is a pinned input (default to a pinned version, not blind `latest`). | **Alternatives**: install-then-verify; trust TLS alone. | **Rationale**: a supply-chain-sensitive tool (ADR-007) must FAIL CLOSED — a tampered/truncated download must never reach PATH. Verifying before placement and deleting partials guarantees no half-verified binary is runnable. No admin/sudo (user-local install dir); TLS 1.2+ enforced (`install.ps1`).

### Decision: D12 — Test split: `npm test` stays green with NO binary; `npm run smoke:binary` validates artifacts
**Choice**: everything CI-independent is unit-tested as DATA/pure functions in the default vitest run (never touches a binary); artifact validation lives in `*.smoke.test.ts` excluded from `npm test` and run only by `npm run smoke:binary` (requires `DBGRAPH_BINARY_PATH`). | **Alternatives**: gate `npm test` on a built binary. | **Rationale**: mirrors the proven `*.integration.test.ts` exclusion pattern (`vitest.config.ts` already excludes a suffix). `npm test` must be green on any machine with no build artifacts (CI-independence, contributor-friendliness); the binary is validated locally/opt-in.

# ADR-009: Standalone binaries via Node SEA

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-07-06 · **Refines:** ADR-006 (bundling clause), ADR-008 (determinism)

**Context:** US-037 asks for a single-file, self-contained CLI a user runs with NO Node.js and NO
`node_modules` (codegraph parity). Phase 9.5b removed the last native module from the local index
(the `node:sqlite` storage seam), making a native-free binary possible. Two toolchains were on the
table: `bun build --compile` and Node SEA (single executable applications). ADR-006 had earlier
written "static bundling in the binaries" for the drivers, which conflicts with ADR-006's own
"works without any driver installed" guarantee and with keeping the 5 drivers optional.

**Decision:**
1. Build standalone binaries with **Node SEA**, not `bun build --compile`: one toolchain, alignment
   with the 9.5b `node:sqlite` seam, no second runtime, an official Node feature.
2. Pin the build+embed Node to **24 LTS** (exact patch in `.nvmrc`) so `node:sqlite` needs NO
   runtime flag (`--experimental-sqlite` was dropped after 23.4) and output is deterministic (ADR-008).
3. **Refine ADR-006's "static bundling in the binaries" clause:** the 5 DB drivers and
   `better-sqlite3` are NOT statically bundled. They stay `external`, lazy, and optional (dynamic
   import) — exactly as on the npm path. The binary's guaranteed capability is READ/serve of an
   already-indexed graph on the in-binary `node:sqlite` — zero drivers required. Live extraction from
   the binary loads a driver only when present, resolved from `$CWD/node_modules` → `NODE_PATH` →
   global; absent → the existing `npm i <driver>` error.
4. The binary defaults its local-index store to `node:sqlite`; the npm default stays
   `better-sqlite3` (byte-identical, ADR-008).

**Consequences:** the small external-driver surface is preserved; "works without any driver
installed" holds for the binary; binary size ≈ the Node runtime (~tens of MB); SEA is experimental
(stability 1.1) so the Node pin is load-bearing across minors; drivers for live extraction are the
user's `npm i`, not shipped; only ADR-006's single bundling sentence is superseded — ADR-006's
pure-JS-driver and lazy-optional decisions stand. macOS + arm64 binaries and any actual release
publication are deferred (9.5d, CI-quota-blocked).

## Testing Strategy

| Layer | What to test | Approach | Runs in |
|-------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Unit | esbuild options are correct DATA | Import `buildOptions(v)`; assert `format==='cjs'`, `platform==='node'`, `bundle===true`, `external` ⊇ all 6 drivers, `define` has the baked version, entry is `sea-entry`. | `npm test` |
| Unit | SEA arg/dispatch logic | `planEntry(argv,isSea)` — assert SEA slice(1) vs npm slice(2), `mcp` routing, `--version`/`--help` pass-through. NO spawn. | `npm test` |
| Unit | `loadOptionalDriver` seam | Inject fake `createRequire`/`import`; assert SEA branch resolves from cwd base, npm branch calls `import(name)`, resolution miss rethrows (→ existing `npm i` catch). | `npm test` |
| Unit | `--version` fallback | Set/unset `process.env.DBGRAPH_BUILD_VERSION`; assert `runCli(['--version'])` prints baked value or `DBGRAPH_VERSION`. | `npm test` |
| Unit | asset-name mapping | `assetName('win32','x64')==='dbgraph-win-x64.exe'`, `assetName('linux','x64')==='dbgraph-linux-x64'`. | `npm test` |
| Regression | npm store default unchanged | With `isSea()===false`, all existing storage goldens BYTE-IDENTICAL (better-sqlite3). | `npm test` |
| Smoke (win) | built exe works with NO node_modules | `vitest.smoke.config.ts`: temp cwd (no node_modules), fixture sqlite source + `driver:node:sqlite` config; run `--version` (== pkg.version), `--help` (USAGE), `init→sync→query <term>` (asserts hit + exit code). | `npm run smoke:binary` |
| Smoke (linux) | built binary in a Node-LESS container | `scripts/sea/smoke-linux.sh`: `debian:bookworm-slim` (no node), same `--version`/`--help`/`init→sync→query`. | manual/local |

**CI-independence guarantee:** `npm test` NEVER requires a binary — every binary-dependent assertion
lives in `*.smoke.test.ts` (excluded via `vitest.config.ts`). The smoke suites require
`DBGRAPH_BINARY_PATH`; absent → they skip (not fail). This is the honest RED→GREEN seam for apply:
config-as-data and pure dispatch/resolution logic go RED→GREEN in `npm test`; the artifact-level
smoke is a separate, opt-in, local gate.

## Migration / Rollout

All-additive. NOTHING in the npm/`dist` runtime path changes behavior: the store default stays
better-sqlite3 unless `isSea()` (only true inside a binary), the driver factories are byte-identical
off-SEA, and the existing `bin` entries are untouched. `--version` is a new, backward-compatible flag.
Rollback = delete the new files (`src/bin/sea-entry.ts`, `scripts/sea/**`, `scripts/install/**`,
`install.*`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.nvmrc`, smoke config/tests, ADR-009), revert the
`open-connections.ts` `isSea()` line, the 4 factory `loadOptionalDriver` swaps, the `cli.ts`/`server.ts`
additions, and the `package.json` scripts/devDeps. The shipped npm package and CLI behavior are
unaffected. No data migration — the `.dbgraph/dbgraph.db` format is identical across drivers (9.5b).

## Apply Batch Ordering (TDD)

0. **Empirical Node/SEA probe (FIRST — decides D3/D5 constants).** On the pinned Node: confirm
   `require('node:sqlite')` works WITHOUT `--experimental-sqlite` (record `process.version`); build a
   throwaway SEA that prints `process.argv` for `./x a b c` to fix the argv slice offset. Record both
   outcomes; if node:sqlite still needs the flag → bump the pin to 24 (preferred) before proceeding.
1. **ADR-009 + bundle (drivers external) + version embed.** ADR-009 file; `esbuild-config.mjs`
   (RED→GREEN on the options-data unit tests) + `build-bundle.mjs`; `sea-entry.ts` + `planEntry`
   tests; `--version` in `runCli` + `startMcpServer` export; `loadOptionalDriver` + 4 factory swaps
   (prove existing factory tests + goldens BYTE-IDENTICAL off-SEA). Assert `build/sea/dbgraph.cjs`
   runs on Node with node_modules PRESENT.
2. **SEA assembly (Windows native) + `open-connections.ts` isSea store flip + win smoke.**
   `sea-config.json` + `build-sea.ps1` + postject → `dbgraph-win-x64.exe`; `vitest.smoke.config.ts` +
   win `*.smoke.test.ts` (`--version`/`--help`/`init→sync→query`, NO node_modules).
3. **Linux leg via Docker + Node-less smoke.** `build-linux-docker` + `build-sea.sh` →
   `dbgraph-linux-x64`; `smoke-linux.sh` in `debian:bookworm-slim`.
4. **`release.yml` (guarded, unfired) + `asset-name.mjs` (unit-tested) + `install.ps1`/`install.sh`
   (SHA256 fail-closed) + `.nvmrc` + US-037 AC reconciliation.** Final denylist/codename scan +
   `tsc` strict + lint + `npm test` green (no binary needed).

## Open Questions

- [ ] **Q1 (driver model scope):** ratify D7 in full (ship `loadOptionalDriver` and make live
      `init/sync` from the binary resolve drivers from CWD/NODE_PATH/global) — or keep 9.5c strictly
      packaging-only and defer robust binary driver resolution, documenting live-from-binary as
      "best effort via NODE_PATH"? Design recommends D7 full (non-SEA path is byte-identical).
- [ ] **Q2 (Node pin patch):** exact Node 24 LTS patch to pin in `.nvmrc`/ADR-009 (confirm the
      current 24-LTS patch and that the dev machine + Docker image both provide it). Batch 0 gates this.
- [ ] **Q3 (SEA argv layout):** confirm empirically whether a SEA `process.argv` is
      `[execPath, ...args]` (slice 1) on the pinned Node — the `planEntry` offset constant depends on it.
- [ ] **Q4 (node:sqlite readOnly on binary):** the sqlite SOURCE adapter opens node:sqlite with
      `{ readOnly: true }` — confirm the option name/behavior on the pinned Node 24 for the smoke's
      `init` step (9.5b validated the writable store path, not the read-only source-open on 24).
- [ ] **Q5 (ExperimentalWarning suppression):** confirm the `process.on('warning')` filter in
      `sea-entry` fully silences the node:sqlite experimental warning, or whether
      `sea-config.json.disableExperimentalSEAWarning` + a startup flag is also needed.
- [ ] **Q6 (Windows postject signing):** confirm whether the copied `node.exe` needs
      `signtool remove /s` (unsigned) before postject on the pinned Node build, and that the produced
      exe runs on a clean Windows without SmartScreen blocking (code signing is explicitly out of scope).
- [ ] **Q7 (macOS leg):** `release.yml` carries the macOS matrix leg but it is NEVER exercised here;
      confirm the leg stays present-but-dormant for 9.5d rather than being removed.
